        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p class="Coding">As listed on the previous file, my favorite hobby is
         programming. Some languages I know include:HTML,CSS, Javascript, and
         SQL(due to prior experience on Khan Academy). I started learning
        Javascript at the age of 8 and would go on to educating myself in
        programming by learning html and css at the age of 10 and and SQL at
        the age of 12. I have had a github domain for a few years now evn though I
        consider my self an amateur web developer. Despite this, I still believe my
        favorite hobby is to code.</p>
