        <h1>Hobbies</h1>

        <p>I have many different hobbies including: reading, playing sports such as
        tennis badminton and soccer, and most importantly coding. Prior to the recent
        events of the global pandemic of a mutated form of SARS known as COVID-19 I
        would check out books from my local library and my school library preferably
        the genre of fantasy, but due to events listed before of the outbreak of COVID-19
        , that is now just theoretical, now online reading has become the norm for me drastically
        increasing my screen time. Even though this may seem as a con, I have happend to realise that
        this may have a positive side due to my understanding of computer programming.
        Other hobbies I had listed before such as playing sports has become merely theoretical
        to the size of a neuron. Despite this I have still found ways to enjoy the wonders of physical
        activity by just playing sports in my backyard. Lastly, coding which i will go more in depth with
        in the next file(Programming.html),coding has been a way for me to create games and web pages
        with platforms including: khan academy and github.</p>
