        <h1>Biography</h1>

        <p>Greetings, my name is Abdullah Ahmed, and I am an amateur web developer
        in many programming languages including:HTML(and CSS within it),
        Javascript, and SQL. I am currently in the  seventh grade with some of
        favorite subjects including PAP (Pre-advanced placement) math, and PAP Science. I like
        to engage in physical activitys such as tennis,badminton, and soccer, but one of my
        most favorite things to do is code along with reading(especially in the fantasy
        genre). I was interested in joining this course due to the fact that I wanted
        to expand my horizon of web development.I have 2 other siblings and parental units
        who encourage me to strive through an omniverse of computer web development.I also
        like animals including cats. </p>
